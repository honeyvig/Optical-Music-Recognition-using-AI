Your Task:
Existing Python code identifies each musical note accurately on various music sheets and adds colors.  Need to create a Flask API for this process and in our AWS environment.
Leverage Github or existing code for music recognition
Simple task for experts
------------------------------------
To create a Flask API for detecting musical notes on music sheets using Computer Vision techniques, we'll follow these steps:

    Pre-requisite: Use an existing music recognition library such as music21 or OpenCV for note detection on music sheets.
    Setup Flask API: Create an API endpoint that processes the uploaded image of a music sheet and returns detected notes.
    Coloring the Notes: For simplicity, the OpenCV library will be used to process the image and overlay colors on detected notes.
    Deployment on AWS: Deploy the Flask API to AWS, making sure it's scalable and accessible.

Pre-requisites:

    Python 3.7 or above
    Flask
    OpenCV
    music21 (for more advanced music notation processing)

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

pip install flask opencv-python numpy music21

Step 2: Python Script to Detect Notes and Color Them

We will use OpenCV to detect notes based on image processing techniques and Flask to serve the process via an API.
note_detector.py (Music Note Detection Logic)

import cv2
import numpy as np
from music21 import *

def detect_notes(image_path):
    # Load the image from the file
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply thresholding to highlight notes
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 150, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)

    # Find contours (representing the notes)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    notes = []

    for contour in contours:
        # Approximate each contour to a rectangle
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)

        # Only consider rectangles of a certain size (representing notes)
        if w > 10 and h > 10:
            # Color detected notes in red
            cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 0, 255), 2)
            
            # Add the position of the note to the list
            notes.append((x, y, w, h))
    
    # Save the processed image with colored notes
    cv2.imwrite('output_colored_notes.png', img)

    return notes

In this script:

    detect_notes(): It reads the image, converts it to grayscale, and uses thresholding to make the notes more prominent. The contours represent the notes that we want to highlight on the music sheet.
    We then draw rectangles around the detected notes (you can customize this based on your specific note detection logic).
    notes: A list of bounding boxes representing detected notes.

Step 3: Flask API for Music Sheet Note Detection
app.py (Flask API for the music sheet processing)

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
from note_detector import detect_notes

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set the upload folder and allowed extensions for images
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads/'
app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS'] = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'bmp'}

# Ensure the upload folder exists
os.makedirs(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], exist_ok=True)

# Function to check if the uploaded file is a valid image
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS']

# API to upload and process the music sheet
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file part'}), 400
    file = request.files['file']
    
    if file.filename == '':
        return jsonify({'error': 'No selected file'}), 400
    
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        file.save(filepath)
        
        # Detect notes in the uploaded music sheet
        notes = detect_notes(filepath)
        
        # Return the detected notes with their coordinates
        return jsonify({'message': 'Notes detected successfully', 'notes': notes}), 200
    
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid file format. Please upload a valid image file.'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Flask API:

    File Upload Handling: The /upload route handles POST requests where users can upload their music sheet image.
    File Processing: The uploaded image is passed to the detect_notes() function from note_detector.py to identify the notes.
    Response: After processing, the server returns a JSON response containing the coordinates of the detected notes and a success message.

Step 4: Running Flask Locally

To run the Flask app locally, simply execute:

python app.py

Your API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/upload. You can test it by sending a POST request with an image using Postman or cURL.

Example using cURL to test the API:

curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_music_sheet_image.png" http://localhost:5000/upload

Step 5: Deploying on AWS

To deploy this on AWS, you can follow these steps:

    Set up an EC2 instance or use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your Flask application.
    Ensure that the instance has the required libraries (flask, opencv, numpy, music21) installed.
    Use Amazon S3 for storing uploaded images if necessary, or configure the instance to store them locally.
    Set up IAM roles to grant necessary permissions for the AWS resources.

Step 6: Optimization and Improvements

    Accuracy: The note detection algorithm can be fine-tuned to be more accurate, depending on the quality and variety of music sheets you are processing.
    Real-time processing: For real-time usage, you can use AWS Lambda with API Gateway instead of a long-running Flask app on EC2.
    AWS Elastic File Storage: Use for storing large or many music sheet images.

Conclusion

This Flask API provides a simple and scalable solution for detecting musical notes on images of music sheets. It leverages OpenCV for image processing and Flask to create a user-friendly interface. You can extend this with more advanced machine learning models for more precise recognition or integrate it into a larger application for music sheet analysis.
